# whatufind | Code faster with prebuild boilerplate

Project name is a `whatufind` which `provides boilerplate code to kickstart your rn projct with restyle theme`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed the latest version of `nodejs`
* You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine.
* >**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Getting Started

#### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your my-care-mobile project dir:

```bash
yarn start
```

#### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your my-care-mobile project dir. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
